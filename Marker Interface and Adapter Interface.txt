if an interface doesn't contain any methods and implementation that interface in our objects will get some ability such type of interfaces are called marker interface or ability interface or tag interface

example
=======
serializable
clonable
RandomAccesses

without having any methods in marker interface how objects will get some ability?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
internally JVM is responsible to provide required ability.

why JVM is providing required ability in marker interface?
------------------------------------------------------------
to reduce complexity of the programming

Adapter Pattern
===============
The adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. it acts as bridge between two incompatable interfaces.

abstract class vs interface
===========================
1. if we dont know about implementation just we have requirement specification then we should go for interface.

if we are talking about implementation but not completely(partial implementation) then we should go for abstract class.

2. inside interface every method is always public and abstract whether we are declaring or not.

every method present inside abstract class need not be public and abstract.

3. inside interface every variable is always public, static final variable whether we are declaring or not.

inside abstract class variables need not be public static final

4. inside interface we can't take static and instance blocks
   inside abstract class we can take both static and instance blocks.

5. inside interface we can't take constructor.
   inside abstract class we can take constructor.

6. for the interface variable compulsory we perform initlialization at the time of declaration otherwise we will get compiletime error.

it is not required to perform  initialization for abstract class variables at the time of declaration.

we cant create Object for abstract class but abstract class can contain constructor what is the need?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
abstract class constructor will be executed when ever we are creating child class Object to perform initialization of child object
